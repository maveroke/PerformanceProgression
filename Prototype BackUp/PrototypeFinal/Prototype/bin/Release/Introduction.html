<p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br />
</strong><strong><br />
  Why performance progression is important</strong><br />
  In the selection of athletes for high-level training and coaching, many track and field programmes have paid considerable attention to the rate at which performance improves once an athlete is accepted into a programme.  Unless required levels of progress are maintained, the ultimate objective of the athlete's membership of the programme is unlikely to be attained. Athletes who do not meet progressive goals are usually excluded from the programme. If it is the desire of a national athletics federation to develop a cost effective programme for groups of yet to be identified and developing athletes there is the need to establish and implement an effective performance monitoring system that informs the athlete of what is required at each stage of the development pathway. The establishment of ultimate performance goals, yearly progression performance goals and a rate of progression that reflects the unique characteristics of each event are required for each athlete. If the developing athlete is to achieve a high level of success, a good start is to base the goals on the performances achieved by older successful athletes in the same event, when they were at the same stage of development.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>What you can do with this CD performance progression tool</strong><br />
  This CD performance progression tool allows you to plot an athlete's competition performances onto a chart to see (a) how an athlete is progressing over any period of time, and (b) how their progression compares to elite athletes who have had or are having successful careers. Athlete performance data can be added at any time to gauge an up-to-date assessment of progress. If the performance trend line is approaching or is in the zone of other successful athletes, then decisions can be made about future goals and a future international competition programme. Further, if the performance progression trend declines before reaching the age-related peak, coaches can determine assess cause and implement remedial measures.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Background of the development of the CD performance progression tool</strong><br />
  Hollings, Hume, &amp; Trewin (1997) developed a method to monitor performance progression and published a booklet Successful athletes: Role of performance progression that tabled and plotted the performance progression of 390 successful athletes across 36 track and field events. Competition results were obtained from a variety of sources and included the athlete's life-time best performance and yearly best performance only. The selected athletes all ranked in the world all-time top 50 athletes for their event. When describing the methodology used to generate the performance plots, we outlined a number of limitations of the original method: <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>only taking into consideration the athlete's single best performance in any one year; </li>
  <li>the small cohort of athletes used in the construction of the performance progressions for each event; </li>
  <li>the arbitrary selection of athletes that were used in the analysis (i.e., only recently retired athletes were used); </li>
  <li>the age of the athlete at the time of achieving their year best performance was rounded down to the full year of age; </li>
  <li>discarding performances that were achieved indoor, wind aided, or at altitude; </li>
  <li>discarding performances in all throwing events that were achieved prior to the age of 18; </li>
  <li>discarding data for the men's Javelin Throw prior to 1988, as a new specification for the javelin was introduced in that year; </li>
  <li>not including data for the women's Hammer Throw, women's Pole Vault, women's 3000-m Steeplechase, and women's 5000-m as it was not extensive enough due to the relatively recent introduction of these events at the time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, Athletics UK (in 2006) and Athletics New Zealand (in 2009) adopted the original methodology pioneered by Hollings, Hume &amp; Trewin (in 2007) to produce a series of &quot;performance funnels&quot; to monitor both their elite and developing athletes. These performances funnels used the same methodology, but addressed a few of the limitations that we had identified including the use of performances of a greater number of athletes for each event and including data for events we had not included in our earlier work.</p>
<p>The current CD performance progression tool is a computer based system rather than the booklet form, which allows users to plot their own data interactively.  The revised method to calculate the performance progression of successful athletes addressed the limitations outlined in our previous work, and provides the user with a visual display of how their progression compares directly with elite athletes as well as the ability to be able to plot every known performance, rather than the single best performance of the year. In most cases a single best performance is not fully reflective of an athlete's ability to reproduce this performance. <br />
  The CD performance progression tool is based on analysis of a large data set - A total of 168,576 performances by 2017 identified athletes across 38 track and field events were used in the construction of the performance plots.   All published career competition performances for 1026 male and 991 female track and field athletes who finished in the top 16 (track events and combined events) or top 12 (field events) of their event at an Olympic Games or a World Athletics Championships between 2000 and 2009 was used for the construction of individual performance trends. <br />
  All known performances for each athlete throughout their entire career was used, rather than using the single best performance in any one year, which was the approach taken in previous work. <br />
  The exact age of the athlete on the day of the performance was calculated and used in the performance trends, rather than where the age in years only was used previously. For example, there is a substantial difference between being 17 years and one day old versus being 17 years and 364 days old, when referring to the age being 17 years. <br />
  Another characteristic of the current work is that each athlete has a unique performance trend line. On looking at any event progression plot it can be seen that athletes progress at very different rates throughout their athletics careers. One of the limitations of previous work was that mean values of performance at a specific age by all athletes in the event was used, and the &quot;mean value athlete&quot; was used as the benchmark progression. The current approach allows for each athlete's individual progression to be compared to individual athletes who have been successful on the world stage. A unique feature of the performance graphs is that if the cursor is placed on any performance trend line, the name of the athlete will appear. New performance data for any developing athlete can be entered into the performance trends graph and a unique performance trend will be generated for this athlete. Developing athletes can then compare their performance progression trend line with athletes who have already progressed to be successful. <br />
  The new method ensures that the new performance progression trends are valid and reflective of the actual performance progression of successful athletes.<br />
