Fixed how I store the files for the HTML Pages
Fixed how the files are setup in the SetUp section

Ive also Hidden the "Made" "M""W""Track""Field" excel files that are stored within the application. 
Im not sure if that will affect anything. Testing will need to be done

Programs been tested. Everything seems functional
{W1}forms in the Help Menu are resizeable
{W2}there are ways to make the contents form play up
	Size wise
	Being visible when a form is open (Dont ask how I did that... it was Magic)
Hidden files dont seem to affect how the program works so thats good
{W3}might want to put the HTML files and the Images into the application rather than the temp files as
   they're only used if you have to edit the data.
{W4}Authors and About forms still have that checkbox at the bottom. Should look at removing that.

So broken program.
Tried implementing product key protection
{P}Activation screws up
{P}Trial 1 day to go screws up (Have a checker or something to say if less than 1day then make it 1 still)

managed to get the product key and secret location for dates working mostly.
Program disables itself if trials limit reached
Program enables itself if trial time still exists.

Currently editing the DataVolume Display.

Need to still 
Update the Data Form <-not apart of Contents form
Finish updating the Data on the Contents form

Currently I have linked it to a web page for displaying the data.
Removed the txt reader as it was too complex. Seems simpler to display in a web page.
