<p><a name="1save" id="1save"><strong>How do I Save?</strong></a><br />
  When you are working in a document, up the top in the Menu Bar click Save or  press Ctrl + S to save the document. Also by closing the form if you have done  work but haven’t saved the program will prompt you to save if you wish.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="2name"><strong>Can I change the name  of an athlete after creating a document?</strong><br />
  Not at this stage. You would be best to start a new document and copy the data  over manually if you want a new name.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="3calander" id="3calander"><strong>How do I select an  age in the Calendar?</strong></a><br />
  Clicking on the date located at the top-middle of the calendar you can expand  your search to find what day / month / year you are after.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="4event" id="4event"><strong>My event isn’t in the  drop down list. What should I do?</strong></a><br />
  Currently the events that appear in the drop down list are the only ones that  data has been collected for. Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done.  Your event may appear in later versions of the program.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="5program" id="5program"><strong>What is this program  for?</strong></a><br />
  Information on the program is located in the Contents form under the  Introduction tab. Other information such as about the Authors, Data Used and  How to use can also be located here or under the Help Option in the Menu Bar.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="6delete" id="6delete"><strong>How do I delete an  Athlete?</strong></a><br />
  In the menu bar under File there is an option to delete athletes.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="7documents" id="7documents"><strong>Where are the  documents that are created from this program?</strong><br />
  <strong>Why can’t I choose where to save these  files?</strong></a><br />
  The files are stored within the program to help users keep all the documents in  one place. Later on there will be ways to export data to other computers if  desired.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="8files" id="8files"><strong>What am I suppose to  do without the files?</strong></a><br />
  Currently you can print the graph that has been created. A way to export the  graphs will be created in a later release.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="9print" id="9print"><strong>How do I print?</strong></a><br />
  If you have a document open, under the Excel option in the menu bar there is an option to print the graph.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="10lines" id="10lines"><strong>What do all the lines  on the graph mean?</strong></a><br />
  A key / Legend is provided under the Excel option in the Menu Bar. If you want  to know more about the graphs, look into Introduction and About in the Contents  menu or under the Help option in the Menu Bar.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="11graph" id="11graph"><strong>I can’t see the whole  graph, How to I navigate around?</strong></a><br />
  There will be an update later on to navigate the graph easily without the need  for scroll bars.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select and open the Tab &ldquo; New/  Existing File&rdquo;<u></u></li>
  <li>Enter your name. This will appear on  the graph.<u></u></li>
  <li>Enter your gender (sex)<u></u></li>
  <li>Enter your date of birth by choosing  from the calendar<u></u></li>
  <li>Enter the event you want to plot<u></u></li>
  <li>Then select &ldquo;Create New&rdquo;. The graph  for the event will appear.<u></u></li>
</ol>
<p><u> </u><u><img src="HTMLImages/Tester_clip_image002.jpg" alt="CreateNew" width="253" height="267" /></u></p>
<ol>
  <li>On the table at the right side of  the screen, in the left column <br />
  enter the date of the competition (in the format<strong> mm-dd-yyyy)</strong><u></u></li>
  <li>In the right column enter the actual  performance (in the format <br />
  or m:ss.ss or mm:ss.ss for running events or mm.cc  for field events.<u></u></li>
  <li>Keep entering as many performances  (see note 7) as you can <br />
  and the performance trend line and data points will be  updated <br />
  each time you enter a new performance.<u></u></li>
</ol>
<p><u><img src="HTMLImages/Tester_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Data" width="480" height="197" /></u><u> </u></p>
<ol>
  <li>It is important to enter as many  performances as you can to get a <br />
  more accurate description of your performance  trend line. You <br />
  should <u>NOT </u>be selective in which performances you add.  Remember the actual performance trend lines for the other athletes on the chart  were constructed using all available performances – not just their good ones.  You are cheating yourself if you exclude your &ldquo;bad&rdquo; performances. The only  performances you can consider excluding would be say a heat in a competition  where the next round is the same day or a heat where you easily qualified and  did not run to 100%. (New Zealand athletes can gain all of their performances  from their profile on the Athletics New Zealand Rankings Lists page) Wind assisted performances can be  included as we have allowed for this in the performance trend lines. Only use  performances achieved with senior throws implements and performances achieved  with senior hurdle heights.
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Clicking on the chart and moving the  cursor over any performance trend line will reveal the name of the athlete  whose performance trend line it is. The red performance trend lines are for  athletes who have medalled at an Olympic Games or World Championships 2000 –  2010; the blue performances trend lines are for athletes who finished 4th  – 8th at a OG or WC; and the mauve performance trend lines are for  athletes who finished 9th – 16th (track events) or 9th  – 12th (field events) at a OG or WC. (See Legend)</li>
</ol>
<p><u><img src="HTMLImages/Tester_clip_image006.jpg" alt="Hover over a Line" width="418" height="310" /></u><u> </u></p>
<ol>
  <li>Save  your performance trend line by clicking on the  Save icon or <br />
  simply exit the programme.
  <li>If you want to add more performances  at a later stage open the tab &ldquo; New/ Existing File&rdquo; and select your file from  those listed on the right hand column.<u><br clear="all" />

<p><strong><u>How to interpret your trend line</u></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Your trend line appears as a <strong>black</strong> line. The red performance trend lines are for athletes who have medalled at an Olympic Games or World  Championships 2000 – 2010; the blue performances trend lines are for athletes  who finished 4th – 8th at a OG or WC; and the mauve  performance trend lines are for athletes who finished 9th – 16th (track events) or 9th – 12th (field events) at a OG or  WC. (See Legend). The performance trend lines have been constructed by using as  many performance data points as possible – not just the best performance in any  one year – which is misleading. An example of the performance plot and  individual performances of a male World Championships gold medallist in the  200m is shown below. You can see how you are progressing  compared to other international class athletes. You will have noticed that  every athlete has a unique <br />
  performance trend line – some start slowly and  improve rapidly, whilst others start at a higher level and improve at a  slightly lesser rate – however they all succeeded at the international level!</li>
  <li>You can gauge how your rate of  improvement is going simply by adding further performances as they are  achieved.</li>
  <li>If your performance trend line is  tracking down, then you really need to discuss this with your coach.</li>
  <li>If your performance trend line is in  the zone of other successful athletes, then you can start to make some  decisions about your future international programme.</li>
