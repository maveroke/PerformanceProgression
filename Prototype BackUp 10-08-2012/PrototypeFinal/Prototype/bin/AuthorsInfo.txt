Steve is currently a PhD Student at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) where his thesis is "The transition from elite junior athlete to successful senior athlete: Implications for high performance programmes". Steve's supervisors are Professor Patria Hume (AUT) and Associate Professor Cliff Mallett (University of Queensland).  Steve holds a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) from the University of Liverpool Faculty of Medicine, a Diploma in Special Education (Education of Students with Special Teaching Needs), and a Higher Diploma of Teaching (Higher Dip. Tchg.) from the Auckland College of Education, as well as a Certificate in Education (Cert. Ed., Dip. P.E.) Major in Physical Education with distinction in Physical Education and in the Practice of Education, from the Madeley College of Education, University of Keele. 

After graduating in 1969, Steve was a Teacher of Physical Education at Mexborough Grammar and Sixth Form College, Yorkshire. In 1972 Steve became a Lecturer in Physical Education at the University of Liverpool, where he undertook lecturing on both undergraduate degree and post graduate diploma courses in Physical Education. Steve took up the position of Director - Physical Recreation at The University of Auckland in 1976 and established the Sports Science Laboratory there in 1981. From 1994 until 1997 he was the National Director of Coaching for Athletics New Zealand. In 1997, he became the Director of the High Performance Programme for Athletics New Zealand. When funding for the position dried up in 2000, Steve took the position as Senior Manager - Education for the International Association of Athletics Federations, based in Monaco where he had the direct responsibility for the education and training of athletics coaches and technical officials of the 211 countries that the IAAF serviced. Steve returned to New Zealand in 2003 to take up the role of General Director of the IAAF's High Performance Training Centre for Oceania which was based at the Millennium Institute of Sport & Health. The Centre closed in 2008 and was relocated to Australia's Gold Coast. Steve is now "retired", but apart from his PhD is also the Statistician for Athletics New Zealand, and serves on the Board of Athletics New Zealand.

In the area of personal sports performance, Steve is an Olympic athlete, competing for Great Britain in the 3000m Steeplechase at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. Steve also represented England in the same event at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch and was the British Champion in the event twice (1971 & 1972), Steve has also represented New Zealand in athletics in a "test match" versus Australia (1977) and was the New Zealand Champion in the 3000m Steeplechase in 1977. He represented Great Britain in international competitions on over 40 separate occasions.

In the area of Team Management, Steve has attended six Olympic Games and has gained probably the unique record of having represented three different countries (Great Britain as an athlete, New Zealand as a coach and manager, and Samoa as a coach) at these six Olympic Games. Similarly, he has represented three different countries (England as an athlete, New Zealand as a coach and manager, and Tonga, as a coach) at the seven Commonwealth Games he has attended. As well, Steve was the New Zealand Athletics Team Manager or Coach at two Olympic Games (Seoul 1998, and Sydney 2000), three Commonwealth Games (Brisbane 1982, Edinburgh 1986, Kuala Lumpur 1998), four World Athletics Championships (Rome, 1987, Tokyo, 1991, Athens, 1997, Seville, 1999) and one World Indoor Championships (Maebashi, 1999). Steve was Team coach for Tonga at the 2005 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki and at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Steve was Team Coach for Samoa at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

In the area of athletics coaching Steve has been and is the personal coach to athletes from Samoa, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Fiji. Under Steve's tutelage each athlete had set new national records in their event, whilst Aunesse Cureen (Samoa) became the first Pacific Island athlete ever to run under 4 minutes for the 1 mile. Steve took Aunese Curreen to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, where he became the only athlete in the heats of the 800m to set a new National Record (1:47.45). Aunese also won the New Zealand National 800m title two years in a row. Steve is an International Association of Athletics Federations Academy Lecturer Coach. Steve has taught and lectured on many courses and conferences including a IAAF High Level Middle Distance Seminar in Adelaide in 2000, Level 2 Courses in Jakarta (1998 & 1999), Nairobi (2001) and Singapore (2002).

Introduction

In the selection of athletes for high-level training and coaching, many track and field programmes have paid considerable attention to the rate at which performance improves once an athlete is accepted into a programme. Unless required levels of progress are maintained, the ultimate objective of the athlete's membership of the programme is unlikely to be attained. Athletes who do not meet progressive goals are usually excluded from the programme. If it is the desire of a national athletics federation to develop a cost effective programme for groups of yet to be identified and developing athletes there is the need to establish and implement an effective performance monitoring system that informs the athlete of what is required at each stage of the development pathway. The establishment of ultimate performance goals, yearly progression performance goals and a rate of progression that reflects the unique characteristics of each event are required for each athlete. If the developing athlete is to achieve a high level of success, the goals need to be based on the performances achieved by older successful athletes in the same event, when they were at the same stage of development.

In an attempt to address the establishment of a method to monitor performance progression, Hollings, Hume, & Trewin, in 1997, published a booklet Successful athletes: Role of performance progression that tabled and plotted the performance progression of successful athletes across 36 track and field events. When describing the methodology used to generate the performance plots, they outlined a number of limitations. The limitations were identified as; only taking into consideration the athlete's single best performance in any one year; the small cohort of athletes used in the construction of the performance progressions for each event; the arbitrary selection of athletes that were used in the analysis, i.e., only recently retired athletes were used; the age of the athlete at the time of achieving their year best performance was rounded down to the full year of age; discarding performances that were achieved indoor, wind aided, or at altitude; discarding performances in all throwing events that were achieved prior to the age of 18; discarding data for the men's Javelin Throw prior to 1988, as a new specification for the javelin was introduced in that year; data for the women's Hammer Throw, women's Pole Vault, women's 3000-m Steeplechase, and women's 5000-m was not extensive enough due to the relatively recent introduction of these events at the time. Subsequently, Athletics UK (in 2006) and Athletics New Zealand (in 2009) adopted the original methodology pioneered by Hollings, Hume & Trewin to produce a series of "performance funnels" to monitor both their elite and developing athletes. These performances funnels were based on a similar methodology to the original work of Hollings, Hume, & Trewin, and addressed only a few of limitations that they identified. 

The aim of the current work therefore was to develop a fresh, innovative method to calculate the performance progression of successful athletes that addressed the limitations outlined in the previous work.

This current work is characterized by the use of much more data. All published career competition performances for 1026 male and 991 female track and field athletes who finished in the top 16 (track events and combined events) or top 12 (field events) of their event at an Olympic Games or a World Athletics Championships between 2000 and 2009 was used for the construction of individual performance trends. A total of 168,576 performances by these 2017 identified athletes across 38 track and field events were used in the construction of the performance plots. All known performances for each athlete throughout their entire career was used, rather than using the single best performance in any one year, which was the approach taken in previous works. Further, the exact age of the athlete on the day of the performance was calculated and used in the performance trends, rather than previously where the age in years only was used. There is a substantial difference between being say 17 years and one day old and 17 years and 364 days old, and referring the age to being just 17 years old. One other characteristic of the current work is that each athlete has a unique performance trend line. On looking at any event progression plot it can be seen that athletes progress at very different rates throughout their athletics careers. One of the limitations of previous works was that mean values of performance at a specific age by all athletes in the event was used, and the "mean value athlete" was used as the benchmark progression. The current approach allows for each athlete's individual progression to be compared to those athletes who have been successful on the world stage. A unique feature of the performance graphs is that if the cursor is placed on any performance trend line, the name of the athlete will appear. New performance data for any developing athlete can be inputted onto the performance trends graph and a unique performance trend will be generated for this athlete. Developing athletes can then compare their performance progression trend line with athletes who have already progressed to be successful.

The new method ensures that the new performance progression trends are valid and reflective of the actual performance progression of successful athletes.
