  <li>Enter your date of birth by choosing  from the calendar<u></u></li>
  <li>Enter the event you want to plot<u></u></li>
  <li>Then select &ldquo;Create New&rdquo;. The graph  for the event will appear.<u></u></li>

<ol>
  <li>On the table at the right side of  the screen, in the left column <br />
  enter the date of the competition (in the format<strong> mm-dd-yyyy)</strong><u></u></li>
  <li>In the right column enter the actual  performance (in the format <br />
  or m:ss.ss or mm:ss.ss for running events or mm.cc  for field events.<u></u></li>
  <li>Keep entering as many performances  (see note 7) as you can <br />
  and the performance trend line and data points will be  updated <br />
  each time you enter a new performance.<u></u></li>
</ol>
<p><u><img src="HTMLImages/Tester_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Data" width="480" height="197" /></u><u> </u></p>
<ol>
  <li>It is important to enter as many  performances as you can to get a <br />
  more accurate description of your performance  trend line. You <br />
  should <u>NOT </u>be selective in which performances you add.  Remember the actual performance trend lines for the other athletes on the chart  were constructed using all available performances – not just their good ones.  You are cheating yourself if you exclude your &ldquo;bad&rdquo; performances. The only  performances you can consider excluding would be say a heat in a competition  where the next round is the same day or a heat where you easily qualified and  did not run to 100%. (New Zealand athletes can gain all of their performances  from their profile on the Athletics New Zealand Rankings Lists page) Wind assisted performances can be  included as we have allowed for this in the performance trend lines. Only use  performances achieved with senior throws implements and performances achieved  with senior hurdle heights.
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Clicking on the chart and moving the  cursor over any performance trend line will reveal the name of the athlete  whose performance trend line it is. The red performance trend lines are for  athletes who have medalled at an Olympic Games or World Championships 2000 –  2010; the blue performances trend lines are for athletes who finished 4th  – 8th at a OG or WC; and the mauve performance trend lines are for  athletes who finished 9th – 16th (track events) or 9th  – 12th (field events) at a OG or WC. (See Legend)</li>

<p><strong><u>How to interpret your trend line</u></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Your trend line appears as a <strong>black</strong> line. The red performance trend lines are for athletes who have medalled at an Olympic Games or World  Championships 2000 – 2010; the blue performances trend lines are for athletes  who finished 4th – 8th at a OG or WC; and the mauve  performance trend lines are for athletes who finished 9th – 16th (track events) or 9th – 12th (field events) at a OG or  WC. (See Legend). The performance trend lines have been constructed by using as  many performance data points as possible – not just the best performance in any  one year – which is misleading. An example of the performance plot and  individual performances of a male World Championships gold medallist in the  200m is shown below. You can see how you are progressing  compared to other international class athletes. You will have noticed that  every athlete has a unique <br />
  performance trend line – some start slowly and  improve rapidly, whilst others start at a higher level and improve at a  slightly lesser rate – however they all succeeded at the international level!</li>
  <li>You can gauge how your rate of  improvement is going simply by adding further performances as they are  achieved.</li>
  <li>If your performance trend line is  tracking down, then you really need to discuss this with your coach.</li>
  <li>If your performance trend line is in  the zone of other successful athletes, then you can start to make some  decisions about your future international programme.</li>
